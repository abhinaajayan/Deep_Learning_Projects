# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of Deep Learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid data such as images. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks because they can automatically detect important features like edges, shapes, and textures.

## How CNN Works
A CNN typically consists of the following layers:

- **Convolution Layer** – Extracts important features from the input image using filters (kernels).
- **Activation Function (ReLU)** – Introduces non-linearity into the model.
- **Pooling Layer** – Reduces the spatial size of the feature maps to decrease computation and prevent overfitting.
- **Flatten Layer** – Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layer** – Performs final classification or prediction.

## Why CNN is Powerful
- Automatically learns features (no manual feature extraction needed)
- Handles high-dimensional image data efficiently
- Reduces number of parameters compared to traditional neural networks

## Applications
CNNs are commonly used in:
- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Face Recognition
- Medical Image Analysis
- Autonomous Vehicles

## Conclusion
Convolutional Neural Networks have revolutionized image processing and computer vision by enabling machines to understand visual data with high accuracy. They are one of the most important architectures in modern Deep Learning.
