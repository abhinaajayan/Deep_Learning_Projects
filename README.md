## Introduction
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, particularly the way neurons process information.

Deep Learning enables computers to automatically learn patterns from large amounts of data without being explicitly programmed.

## How It Works
Deep learning models consist of multiple layers of neurons, including:

- Input Layer – Receives the data
- Hidden Layers – Extract and learn features
- Output Layer – Produces the final prediction

These multiple layers allow the model to learn complex patterns, which is why it is called "deep" learning.

## Applications
Deep Learning is widely used in:

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Speech Recognition
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Medical Diagnosis
- Autonomous Vehicles

## Common Frameworks
Popular deep learning frameworks include:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch

## Conclusion
Deep Learning has transformed artificial intelligence by enabling systems to achieve human-level performance in many tasks. With increasing data availability and computational power, deep learning continues to advance rapidly.
